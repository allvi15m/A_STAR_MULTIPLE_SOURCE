\section{Conclusion}
In this chapter, an energy management solution for DERs contained in a distribution grid or a microgrid is discussed. The solution is based on the graph search based solution discussed in Chapter \ref{A8_cahp} and uses DC power-flow and quadratic programming to get the most cost optimum solution. The algorithm has been verified against GA and PSO based methods offline. The proposed algorithm shows significant gains in terms of time needed to complete calculations and cost savings. It is also shown that the algorithm can be modified to get faster calculation time sacrificing cost savings. This trait makes the algorithm tune able based on the specifications of the problem. Finally, the algorithm was validated using CHIL and the validation shows negligible difference from the offline behaviour.
